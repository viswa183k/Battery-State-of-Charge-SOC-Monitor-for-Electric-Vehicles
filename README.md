# Battery State of Charge (SOC) Monitor for EV  

### 📌 Overview  
This project monitors the **battery charge level** (SOC) of an Electric Vehicle using Arduino and a voltage divider circuit. It shows the battery voltage and percentage on an LCD and gives a **low-battery alert** using a buzzer.  

### ⚡ Features  
- Real-time SOC calculation  
- LCD display of voltage & charge percentage  
- Buzzer warning when SOC < 20%  
- Helps prevent sudden EV shutdown  

### 🛠️ Components Required  
- Arduino UNO  
- Voltage Divider (Resistors)  
- 16x2 LCD  
- Buzzer  
- Jumper wires  

### 🚗 Applications  
- EV dashboard battery level monitoring  
- SOC display in e-bikes and e-cars  
- Safety feature for extended EV battery life
